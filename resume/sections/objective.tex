\begin{ResumeSection}{OBJECTIVE}
    Over the past few years I have gained professional experience in software driven environments leveraging new technologies and research to face a variety of challenges such as automated drug discovery. Outside of work and my studies, I develop NLP, RL, and optimisation projects to produce innovative solutions to emerging problems and social issues. I look to utilise these concepts to address major challenges in a professional setting while showcasing and developing my skills. I also enjoy reseach and delving into new and difficult areas of science and technology keeping focus towards statistical analysis and machine learning.
