# LaTeX Resume Template

Compiled resume PDF from LaTeX. The original template used is a generic [FAANG-styled](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/faangpath-simple-template/npsfpdqnxmbc) resume. The resume template is attributed accordingly but a few changes were made so keeping this maintained can be easier.

- Well-defined resume field abstraction (class definitions)
- Multi-file template layout
- Added additional fields such as volunteering and certifications
